 * BFS, DFS, etc
 * Graph problems - insert, delete, topological sort, cycle detection, etc.
 * AVL tree insertion
 * Trie trees
 * Dijsktra using Min Heap
 * Hashtable
 * Is subset problem
 * BST problems - insertion, deletion, travel, hasPath, mirror, doubleTree, maxUniLabel, IsSameTree, diameter, height, mininum value node
 * Heap
